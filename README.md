# Problem

A newspaper editor was researching immigration data trends on H1B(H-1B, H-1B1, E-3) visa application processing over the past years, trying to identify the occupations and states with the most number of approved H1B visas. She has found statistics available from the US Department of Labor and its [Office of Foreign Labor Certification Performance Data](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis). But while there are ready-made reports for [2018](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2018/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2018_Q4.pdf) and [2017](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2017/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2017.pdf), the site doesn’t have them for past years. 

As a data engineer, you are asked to create a mechanism to analyze past years data, specifically calculate two metrics: **Top 10 Occupations** and **Top 10 States** for **certified** visa applications.

Your code should be modular and reusable for future. If the newspaper gets data for the year 2019 (with the assumption that the necessary data to calculate the metrics are available) and puts it in the `input` directory, running the `run.sh` script should produce the results in the `output` folder without needing to change the code.

# Approach

The given input file is scanned. Total no. of applications which was 'certified' is counted. For each row a dictionary is built which contains the state and count of applications certified in that state.
similarly another dictionary contains designation of the job and its count. The count and total application is used to calculate the percentage of each job designation and also the state.

To write on to the file as pe the requirement I have used Lamda function which sorts first with respect to the count of state or job designation and then if there is a tir sorts alphabetically. 

# Instructions

run.sh and run_tests.sh can be run which in turns runs the python file and test files respectively.
